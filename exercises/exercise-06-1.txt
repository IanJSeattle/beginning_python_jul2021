Exercise 6-1

Start up the interactive Python interpreter on your computer, or load
the site https://repl.it/languages/python3.

In the interpreter, create a variable called "card", and assign it the
value of "2 of hearts".

Once this has been created, type the bare word "card" into the
interpreter, and press enter.  What happens?

Now type in "print(card)".  What happens?  Is it different?  How is it
different?
