Exercise 7-1

Start up the interactive Python interpreter.

Create a new variable called "my_int", and assign the value 2 to it.
Remember that an int doesn't have quotes around it.

Create a new variable called "my_float", and assign the value 7.5 to
it.

Try using the arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) on combinations of
my_int and my_float.  Try to predict what type (int or float) each
operation will produce.

Try running "type()" on the results (for instance, "type(my_int +
my_float)".

Do the types of the results match what you had expected?
