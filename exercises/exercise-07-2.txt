Exercise 7-2

Start up the interactive Python interpreter.

Create a new variable called "my_string", and assign the value "hello
there" to it.

Run the following methods on my_string:

my_string.lower()
my_string.upper()
my_string.capitalize()
my_string.title()

Using the + operator, try joining my_string with ", bob".

Using the my_int variable from the previous exercise (create it again
if you stopped the interpreter between the two exercises), try joining
my_string and my_int together with the + operator.

Using my_float (again, recreate it if necessary), try joining my_string
and my_float with the + operator.
