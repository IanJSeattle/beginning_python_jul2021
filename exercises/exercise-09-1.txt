Exercise 9-1

In your editor, create a new file, which will be saved in your
"students" directory, called "exercise_9_1.py".

Create a new list variable, containing a list of four player's names.
These can be any four names you like.

Add another name to the list, by using the .append() method on your new
list variable.  The name to be added goes in between the parentheses of
the .append() method.

Use the print() function to produce the following output:

People in my game:
name
name
name
name
name

...where the five names listed are the names from your list variable.

When finished with your exercise, use git to check in and upload your
new file.  You should do this with every exercise from here on.

Use the following commands to accomplish this:

git status (shows information on the current status of your repo)
git add <filename> (add the new file to your current commit)
git commit -m "<checkin message>" (commit staged changes to the repo)
git push -u origin master (push changes up to Gitlab)
    * Note that in the future, you will only have to run "git push"
      without the "-u origin master" options.  "-u origin master" tells
      git that you are setting the [u]pstream path for [origin] to
      point to [master].
