Exercise 11-1

Create a new file in your editor, which will be saved in your
"students" directory as "exercise_11_1.py".

Create a new list variable, which contains the names of the four suits
of playing cards: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades.

Write a for loop which prints out the name of each suit.  Try changing
the name of the loop variable; what happens?  Try adding a second
print() statement inside the loop; what happens?

** Hints:

The constructor for a list is square brackets: []

A for loop has the following form:

for variablename in iterator:
    code_to_perform()
