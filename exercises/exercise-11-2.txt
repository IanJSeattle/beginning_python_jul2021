Exercise 11-2

Open a new file.

Create a list of 4-5 people's names.

Create a new list of strings, which uses an F-string inside a list
comprehension.  This list should contain a series of strings which look
something like this:

['1 yuki', '2 bob', '3 sanjay']

...though with your names listed.  This list should start with the
number 1, not zero.

Finally, use a for loop to print each string from your new, ranked list
of names.

** Hints:

An F-string has the format: f'text {expression}'

A list comprehension has the format: [item for item in iterable]

The enumerate function has the format: enumerate(iterable)
