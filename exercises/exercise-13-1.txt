Exercise 13-1

In a new file, assign the value "Hello world" to a new variable.

Using slice notation on the new variable, print out the word "Hello".  Use
the same notation to print the word "world".

Using the third step field of a slice, print out "dlrow olleH" by using a
-1 there.

Make a new list containing the letters A through I.  Use slice notation to
create a new list that contains the letters C through G, using the first
list as the source.

Slice syntax: iterable[start:stop:step]
