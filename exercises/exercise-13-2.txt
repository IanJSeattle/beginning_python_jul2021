Exercise 13-2

Make a new list variable that contains the letter A through G.

Using the equals sign, assign that list to another variable, like this:

my_second_list = my_first_list

Modify element 3 of the new list to be the letter Z, then print out the
contents of both lists.

Repeat these steps from the top, but instead of using simple assignment,
use a whole-list slice, like so:

my_second_list = my_first_list[:]

What happens?
