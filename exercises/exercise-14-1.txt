Exercise 14-1

This example, we'll work on items from a grocery shopping receipt.  Don't
worry about making the prices realistic if you don't want to.

Create a variable that holds a list, which contains at least four tuples.
Each tuple should describe a grocery item, and a price, like this:

("beans", 1.35)

Using a for loop, print out the names of each item on the receipt.  After
the loop, print out the total amount of money spent on the groceries from
the list.

To make a list of tuples, you can use this syntax: [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
