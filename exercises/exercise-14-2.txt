Exercise 14-2

Let's start using playing cards.  We'll represent a playing card using a
tuple, with the value and the suit, like so:

two_of_hearts = (2, 'hearts')

For now, let't stick with the numeric values (ie, no J, Q, K or A) to keep
the math simple.

Make a new list variable, containing two of these card tuples.

Make a for loop that prints out each of the cards in your "hand", and total
up the values (points) of the cards.  Print out this value once the loop
has finished.

Remember that a variable needs to be defined before it can be added to.
