Exercise 15-1

Make a copy of the file where you completed Exercise 14-2.

At the end of the for loop in your new file, add the following line, so it
runs as part of the loop:

answer = input('Press enter to hit, or "s" to stay ')

Still inside the for loop, add an if statement which checks to see if the
answer variable is set to "s".  If it is set to "s", run the break keyword to
break out of the loop in the if statement's code block.
