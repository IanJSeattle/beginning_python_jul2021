Exercise 15-2

For this exercise, we'll implement FizzBuzz, a common technical coding
question during job interviews.

The rules of FizzBuzz are that it should print a number, except:

* Numbers divisible by 3 should print "Fizz" instead
* Numbers divisible by 5 should print "Buzz" instead
* Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 should print "Fizz Buzz"

Create a loop with the range() function that counts up to 30, and prints the
appropriate thing for each number.
