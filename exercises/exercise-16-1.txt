In a new file, create a new dict.  This dict should have the names of
people as the keys, and strings containing their favorite food as the
values.  Put five person/food pairs into the dict.

Using a for loop, print out each person's favorite food, with the
following format:

{name}'s favorite food is {food}

Hints:

Declaring a dictionary: my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
Getting both key and value out of a dictionary: my_dict.items()
