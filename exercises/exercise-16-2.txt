In a new file, create a list, which contains three dictionaries.  Each
dict should represent a playing card, with a suit (eg, 'hearts' or
'spades') and a value (eg, one of 2 through 10).

In a for loop, iterate over the list of cards.  For each card, print
out the value and the suit of the card, and when the loop is done,
print out the total value of all the cards.

Hint: to access a particular key in a dict, use the syntax
my_dict['particular key']
