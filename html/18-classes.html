                        <h2> What is a Class? </h2>

                        <p> Classes are used to represent things.  A class is a
                        data type which has data (attributes) and actions (methods)
                        associated with it.

                        <p> For instance, you might have a <code>Car</code> class,
                        which would have a <code>fuel_level</code> attribute, and
                        <code>accelerator()</code> and <code>brake()</code>
                        methods.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2> A Simple Class </h2>

                        <p><code><pre>class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fuel_level = 0
        self._accelerator_position = 0
        self._brake_position = 0

    def accelerator(self, position):
        self._accelerator_position = position

    def brake(self, position):
        self._brake_position = position</pre></code>
                    </section>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2> Classes Create Objects </h2>

                    <p> Think of a class like a blueprint: it shows how a
                    thing is put together, but is not the actual thing that's
                    built.

                    <p> The actual thing that's built is the <b>object</b>.
                    In Python, you instantiate (that is, build) an object by
                    calling a class like so:

                    <p><code><pre>my_car = Car()</pre></code>

                    <p> Now, <code>my_car</code> is an object, which is an
                    instance of <code>Car</code>.
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2> Object Attributes </h2>

                    <p> An <i>attribute</i> is a variable, which is attached
                    to an object.  In our example so far,
                    <code>fuel_level</code> is the only public variable.

                    <p> Python doesn't have a concept of variable privacy, so
                    by convention, any variable starting with an underbar
                    (like <code>_accelerator_level</code>) is considered
                    private.
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2> Object Methods </h2>

                    <p> A <i>method</i> is a function, which is attached to an
                    object.  The magic of object methods is they have
                    internal access to all the variables of the object.

                    <p> Imagine a <code>PlayingCard</code> object.  It would
                    store its value (2-10, J, Q, K, A), and its suit as
                    attributes.  You could have a <code>points()</code> method
                    that reports its point value.

                    <p> Now, calling <code>jack_of_hearts.points()</code> will
                    return <code>10</code>, instead of <code>'J'</code>, making
                    the math easy.
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2> Live Coding </h2>

                    <p> Now, let's go make a <code>Card</code> class, and a
                    <code>Deck</code> class to represent a deck of cards.
